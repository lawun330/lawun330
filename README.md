<h1 align="center">Greetings üëã from La Wun Nannda</h1>
<h3 align="center">An Undergraduate Exploring Different Fields of CS</h3>


## Introduction
- ‚≠ê I aim to help people with latest technologies.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently studying **General Computer Science and Basic Quantum Computing Concepts**.
- üëØ I want to collaborate on community projects that involves **DS, ML, and QML**.
- üí¨ I have experience in **Arduino and Python**.
- üì´ How to reach me: <u>lawun330@gmail.com</u>


## My Background 
- In my first year at Yangon Technological University (YTU), I helped build a Bluetooth-controlled car for a project show.
- I've independently created various Arduino projects, including a smart home system, IoT temperature control with ThingSpeak API, a door lock, a stopwatch, and a plant monitoring system. More details are in my [Arduino-Learning](https://github.com/lawun330/Arduino-Learning) repository.
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed the code for a "Refiller Robot" which was donated to Wai Bar Gi Hospital in Myanmar. The project, done with my LORA teammates at YTU, was featured on [BBC News Myanmar](https://youtu.be/Vs6lDYDOak4?si=kkbzYx5g9wyoec0Q).
- In 2020, I switched from Arduino to Python, and you can follow my progress in my [Basic-Python-Learning](https://github.com/lawun330/Basic-Python-Learning) repository.
- In 2022, I enrolled in the BSc. program at the University of the People, majoring in Computer Science. Currently, I am involved in several projects and workshops as I strive to work with emerging technologies.
- Since then, I've been delving into various fields of Computer Science including Front-end Development, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Science, and Quantum Algorithms.
