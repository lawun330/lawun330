<h3 align="center">A General Programmar Exploring different fields of CS</h3>

## Introduction
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, DSA, and Computer Science**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to **Data and Humanitarian Crisis**
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding **DSA and SWE concepts**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Arduino, Python, and Operating System**
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <u>lawun330@gmail.com</u>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I attended Electronics Engineering for a year before my first Arduino electronics project ignited my passion for coding.


## My Journey
- With my team, I built a bluetooth controlled car with the Arduino platform on my first academic year.
- I built several fun projects on my own, using the Arduino platform: smart home, IoT temperature control, door lock system, plant monitoring system, etc.
- With my team, I built the **Refiller Robot** using the Arduino platform for COVID-19 era, which was later donated to Wai Bar Gi Hospital, Myanmar. We were from the Laboratory of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (LORA) of Yangon Technological University. The project was interviewed by the [BBC Burmese](https://youtu.be/Vs6lDYDOak4?si=kkbzYx5g9wyoec0Q).
- I jumped from Arduino to Python because of my passion in coding in 2020.
- I explored several different fields of Computer Science.
- I have decided to land my career that involves helping people with the Artificial Intelligence
