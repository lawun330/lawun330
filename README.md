<h1 align="center">Greetings 👋 from La Wun Nannda</h1>

## Introduction
- ⭐ Aspiring to learn the latest technologies, especially in the field of ML and Quantum Computing, to solve real-world problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: <u>lawun330@gmail.com</u>

## My Background 
- My coding journey began with Arduino projects. Check [Arduino-Learning](https://github.com/lawun330/Arduino-Learning).
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed the code for a "Refiller Robot" which was donated to Wai Bar Gi Hospital in Myanmar. The project, done with my LORA teammates at YTU, was featured on [BBC News Myanmar](https://youtu.be/Vs6lDYDOak4?si=kkbzYx5g9wyoec0Q).
- During my undergraduate studies, I explored areas such as front-end development, machine learning, data science, algorithms, AI and quantum computing. My repositories showcase projects and experiments that reflect my growing interest in data-driven solutions and computational problem-solving.

## My Future Vision
Looking ahead, I am eager to continue developing my skills in Machine Learning Engineering, with the hope that one day, I can work at the intersection of ML and Quantum Computing. I am excited by the idea of leveraging quantum algorithms to speed up and enhance ML processes, and I am committed to pursuing a career that combines these two powerful fields.
