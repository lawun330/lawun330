<h3 align="center">An Undergraduate Exploring Different Fields of CS</h3>

## Introduction
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, DSA, and Computer Science**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to **Data and Humanitarian Crisis**
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding **DSA and SWE concepts**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Arduino, Python, and Operating System Architecture**
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <u>lawun330@gmail.com</u>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like Emojicode, a programming language in emojis


## My Journey
- With my team, I created a bluetooth-controlled car for the project show on my first academic year.
- I built several fun projects on my own, using the Arduino platform: smart home, IoT temperature control, door lock system, plant monitoring system, etc.
- With my team, I built the **Refiller Robot** using the Arduino platform for COVID-19 era, which was later donated to Wai Bar Gi Hospital, Myanmar. We were from the Laboratory of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (LORA) of Yangon Technological University. The project was interviewed by the [BBC News Myanmar](https://youtu.be/Vs6lDYDOak4?si=kkbzYx5g9wyoec0Q).
- I jumped from Arduino to Python because of my passion in coding in 2020.
- Since them, I have been exploring several different fields of Computer Science: from Octave and Machine Learning, to Data Science, Algorithms.
- I attended the UoPeople in 2022 to become a CS undergrad.
- I love to get a career that involves helping people with what I know.
